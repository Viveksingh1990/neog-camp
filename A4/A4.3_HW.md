Exercise 1

1.1
Create a function called checkTemperature that takes one argument called temperature. Inside the function, use an if statement to check if the temperature is above 30 degrees Celsius. If it is, console.log a message indicating that it's a hot day.

1.2
Create a function called checkDiscountEligibility that takes two arguments called totalAmount and discountThreshold. Inside the function, use an if/else statement to compare the totalAmount with the discountThreshold. If the totalAmount is greater than or equal to the discountThreshold, console.log a message indicating that the customer is eligible for a discount; otherwise, console.log a message indicating that the customer is not eligible for a discount.

1.3
Create a function called findLargestNumber that takes three arguments called num1, num2, and num3. Inside the function, use an if/else statement to compare the values of num1, num2, and num3. Return the largest number among the three. Call the function with three arguments and console.log the returned value.

1.4

Create a function called calculateBonus that takes three arguments called workedHours, grade, and totalSalary. Inside the function, use if/else statements to check the eligibility for a bonus based on the following criteria:

1. If workedHours is greater than 25 and grade is greater than 85, calculate a 10% bonus on the totalSalary and return the updated total salary.
2. If workedHours is greater than 15 and grade is greater than 75, calculate a 5% bonus on the totalSalary and return the updated total salary.
3. If none of the above conditions are met, return the totalSalary without any bonus.
