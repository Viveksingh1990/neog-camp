1.1 Write a function greetUser that logs "Welcome to our website!" to the console. Call this function to demonstrate its output.

1.2 Write a function greetPerson that takes a name parameter and logs a personalized greeting (e.g., "Hello, [name]! Welcome to our Website!"). Call this function with a sample name and log the result.

1.3 Write a function formatMessage that takes a message parameter and returns it formatted with * on both sides (e.g., *message*). Call this function with a sample message and log the result.

1.4 Write a function combineStrings that takes two string parameters and returns them concatenated with a space in between. Call this function with two words and log the result.

## Exercise 2: Basic Mathematical Operations
2.1 Write a function incrementAge that takes an age parameter and returns the result of adding 1 to it. Call this function with a sample age and log the result.

2.2 Write a function calculateSquare that takes a number parameter and returns its square. Call this function with a sample number and log the result.
