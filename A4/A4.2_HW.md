## Exercise 1: Message and String Manipulation Functions
1.1 Write a function warnUser that takes a userName parameter and returns a message warning the user that they are running out of storage (e.g., "Hey there, [userName] You are running out of storage."). Call this function with a sample name and log the result.

1.2 Write a function congratulationsMessage that takes a message parameter and returns it formatted with $$ symbols on both sides (e.g., $$message$$). Call this function with a sample message and log the result.

1.3 Write a function concatenateKeywords that takes two keyword strings as parameters and returns them joined with a hyphen (e.g., keyword1-keyword2). Call this function with two keywords and log the result.

1.4 Write a function showTertiaryColors that takes six color names as parameters and returns a string listing them as pairs of tertiary colors (e.g., "Six Tertiary Colors: Red-Orange, Yellow-Green, Yellow-Green, etc."). Call this function with six colors and log the result.

## Exercise 2: Basic Calculations and Operations
2.1 Write a function decrementAgeBy10 that takes an age parameter and returns the result of adding 10 to it. (This seems to increase the age by 10 rather than decrement, so confirm the question if intended differently.) Call this function with a sample age and log the result.

2.2 Write a function getRemainder that takes two numbers as parameters and returns the remainder when the first number is divided by the second. Call this function with two sample numbers and log the result.

2.3 Write a function calculateTotalPrice that takes two prices (price1 and price2) and their respective quantities (quantity1 and quantity2). It should return the total price by calculating the sum of both products (e.g., (price1 * quantity1) + (price2 * quantity2)). Call this function with sample values and log the result.
