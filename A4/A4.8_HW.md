## Exercise 1: Daily Surplus/Deficit Calculation
1.1 Define calorie data for each day:

Day 1: 400 calories burnt, 1500 calories intake
Day 2: 450 calories burnt, 1800 calories intake
Day 3: 300 calories burnt, 1600 calories intake
Day 4: 500 calories burnt, 2000 calories intake
Base calorie burn: 1500

1.2 Write a function calculateSurplusDeficit that accepts a day name, burnt calories, intake calories, and base calorie burn. The function should calculate the surplus or deficit by subtracting the intake plus the base burn from the burnt calories. If the result is negative, it should return a deficit report; otherwise, a surplus report. Log the result for each day.

## Exercise 2: Total Calories Burnt
2.1 Write a function calculateTotalBurnt that accepts the calories burnt over four days and returns the total calories burnt. Call this function and log the result.

## Exercise 3: Total Calories Intake
3.1 Write a function calculateTotalIntake that accepts the calorie intake over four days and returns the total calories intake. Call this function and log the result.

## Exercise 4: Weekly Surplus/Deficit
4.1 Write a function calculateTotalSurplus that calculates the total weekly surplus or deficit. This function should subtract the total intake and four times the base calorie burn from the total calories burnt. Call this function and log the total weekly surplus or deficit.

## Exercise 5: Weekly Summary
5.1 Write a function generateWeeklySummary that generates a weekly summary report. The report should include total calories burnt, total calories intake, and total surplus/deficit.

5.2 Add a standing goal award to the weekly summary. If the total calories burnt is 1000 or more, display a congratulatory message for meeting the movement goal. Otherwise, display a message indicating no award.

5.3 Call the generateWeeklySummary function and log the complete weekly summary report.
