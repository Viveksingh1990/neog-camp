## Exercise 1: Product Price Calculation
1.1 Define three products with names, prices, and categories:

Product 1: "Laptop" with a price of 999 in the "Electronics" category
Product 2: "Running Shoes" with a price of 799 in the "Footwear" category
Product 3: "T-shirt" with a price of 199 in the "Clothing" category
1.2 Write a function getTotalPrice that accepts the prices of three products as arguments and returns their total price. Call this function with the prices of the products defined above and log the total price.

## Exercise 2: Applying Discounts

2.1 Define a discount variable representing a 10% discount (0.1).

2.2 Write a function applyDiscountToElectronicProduct that takes a product name, price, category, and discount as parameters. The function should apply the discount to the price only if the category is "Electronics." Otherwise, it should return the original price.

2.3 Calculate the total price of all three products after applying the discount to the electronic product (if applicable). Log the discounted price of the "Laptop" and the final total price after the discount.

## Exercise 3: Generating a Cart Summary
3.1 Write a function generateCartSummary that generates a formatted summary of the products in the cart, showing each product's name, price, discount (if any), and final price after any discounts are applied.

3.2 Within generateCartSummary, create a helper function formatProductInfo that formats each product's details, including the discount and final price.

3.3 Log the complete cart summary, including the final total price of all products after any discounts.
