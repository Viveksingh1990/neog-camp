# ES6+ Practice Question Set 1

Instructions: Avoid usage of in-built methods in javaScript. You can make use of basic methodssuch as .length, toLowerCase(), toUpperCase(), push() if needed. Make use of for-loops and if-else statements wherever needed.

1. Write a function that takes a user's age and determines if they are old enough to vote (age 18 or
older).

// Your ES6 code here

```js
console.log(isEligibleToVote(20)) // Eligible to vote
console.log(isEligibleToVote(18)) // Eligible to vote
console.log(isEligibleToVote(17)) // Not eligible to vote
```
