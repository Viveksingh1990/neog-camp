## Exercise 1

1.  **(Sales Targets Initialization)**
    
    *   Define variables for the sales targets of three employees: `rahulSalesTarget`, `priyaSalesTarget`, and `amitSalesTarget`, and assign them values of `100`, `200`, and `150`, respectively.
    *   Define variables for the actual sales made by these employees: `rahulActualSales`, `priyaActualSales`, and `amitActualSales`, and assign them values of `85`, `180`, and `120`, respectively.
2.  **(Sales Percentage Calculation)**
    
    *   Calculate the sales percentage for each employee by dividing their actual sales by their sales target and multiplying by `100`. Store these values in variables `rahulSalesPercentage`, `priyaSalesPercentage`, and `amitSalesPercentage`.
3.  **(Sales Performance Evaluation for Rahul)**
    
    *   Write conditional statements to evaluate Rahul's performance based on his sales percentage:
        *   If `rahulSalesPercentage` is `90` or higher, set `rahulPerformance` to "High Performer" and calculate `rahulBonusAmount` as `20%` of `rahulActualSales`.
        *   If `rahulSalesPercentage` is between `70` and `90`, set `rahulPerformance` to "Average Performer" and calculate `rahulBonusAmount` as `10%` of `rahulActualSales`.
        *   If `rahulSalesPercentage` is below `70`, set `rahulPerformance` to "Low Performer" and set `rahulBonusAmount` to `0`.
4.  **(Sales Performance Evaluation for Priya)**
    
    *   Write conditional statements to evaluate Priya's performance using the same criteria as Rahul and store the results in `priyaPerformance` and `priyaBonusAmount`.
5.  **(Sales Performance Evaluation for Amit)**
    
    *   Write conditional statements to evaluate Amit's performance using the same criteria as Rahul and store the results in `amitPerformance` and `amitBonusAmount`.
6.  **(Sales Performance Report Logging)**
    
    *   Log a sales performance report to the console that includes:
        *   A header for the report.
        *   Detailed information for each employee including:
            *   Name.
            *   Sales target.
            *   Actual units sold.
            *   Sales percentage.
            *   Performance level.
            *   Bonus amount.
         
## Exercise 2

1.  **(Calories Burnt and Intake Initialization)**
    
    *   Define variables for calories burnt and intake for five days:
        *   `day1Burnt`, `day1Intake`, `day2Burnt`, `day2Intake`, `day3Burnt`, `day3Intake`, `day4Burnt`, `day4Intake`, `day5Burnt`, and `day5Intake`.
    *   Assign appropriate values to these variables:
        *   `day1Burnt = 400`, `day1Intake = 1500`, `day2Burnt = 450`, `day2Intake = 1800`, `day3Burnt = 300`, `day3Intake = 1600`, `day4Burnt = 500`, `day4Intake = 2000`, `day5Burnt = 350`, and `day5Intake = 1700`.
2.  **(Base Calorie Calculation)**
    
    *   Define a variable `baseCalorieBurn` and assign it a value of `1500` to represent the baseline calorie requirement.
3.  **(Surplus Calculation)**
    
    *   Calculate the surplus for each day by subtracting the total intake (calories burnt + base calorie burn) from the calories burnt for that day.
    *   Store the results in variables: `day1Surplus`, `day2Surplus`, `day3Surplus`, `day4Surplus`, and `day5Surplus`.
4.  **(Daily Report Evaluation)**
    
    *   Write conditional statements to evaluate whether there is a surplus or deficit for each day:
        *   If `dayXSurplus > 0`, set `dayXReport` to "Surplus".
        *   Otherwise, set `dayXReport` to "Deficit".
    *   Do this for each day (1 to 5).
5.  **(Total Burnt and Intake Calculation)**
    
    *   Calculate the total calories burnt and total intake over the five days and store these in `totalBurnt` and `totalIntake` variables, respectively.
6.  **(Total Surplus Evaluation)**
    
    *   Calculate the total surplus by summing the daily surpluses and store the result in `totalSurplus`.
    *   Write a conditional statement to determine if the overall report is a surplus or deficit, storing the result in `totalSurplusReport`.
7.  **(Weekly Summary Setup)**
    
    *   Create a string variable `weeklySummary` to summarize the weekly data.
8.  **(Standing Goal Awards)**
    
    *   Write a conditional statement to check if the `totalBurnt` is greater than or equal to `1000`.
    *   If true, set `standingGoalAwards` to a congratulatory message. If false, set it to "No Award yet".
9.  **(Daily Reports Logging)**
    
    *   Log a report to the console that includes:
        *   A header for daily reports.
        *   Daily reports for each day, including:
            *   Day number.
            *   Surplus or deficit status.
            *   Amount of surplus or deficit.
        *   Include the weekly summary of total calories burnt, total intake, total surplus or deficit, and the award message for the standing goal.

2.  **(Expense Initialization)**
    
    *   Define variables for expenses:
        *   `groceries` with a value of `5000`, `utilities` with a value of `2000`, `rent` with a value of `20000`, and `transportation` with a value of `3000`.

5.  **(Budget Surplus/Deficit Calculation)**
    
    *   Determine the budget surplus or deficit by subtracting `totalExpenses` from `totalIncome`, and store the result in `budgetSurplusDeficit`.
6.  **(Budget Status Evaluation)**
    
    *   Write a conditional statement to assess the budget status:
        *   If `budgetSurplusDeficit >= 0`, set `budgetStatus` to "Congratulations! You have a budget surplus."
        *   Otherwise, set `budgetStatus` to "Oops! You have a budget deficit. Consider reducing expenses or increasing income."
7.  **(Spending Insights Evaluation)**
    
    *   Write conditional statements to provide insights based on `totalExpenses`:
        *   If `totalExpenses <= 10000`, set `spendingInsights` to "Great job! You have maintained a low expense level."
        *   If `totalExpenses > 10000 && totalExpenses < 20000`, set it to "Your expenses are moderate. Look for opportunities to reduce unnecessary spending."
        *   If `totalExpenses > 20000 && totalExpenses < 30000`, set it to "Your expenses are on the higher side. Consider creating a more detailed budget to manage your spending."
