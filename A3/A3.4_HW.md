## Exercise

1.  **(1.1)** Grade Assignment Based on Marks
    
    *   Declare a variable `marks` and assign it a numerical value (e.g., 78). Write a series of if-else statements to assign a grade based on the value of `marks`. The grading scale is as follows:
        *   90 and above: "A+"
        *   80 to 89: "A"
        *   70 to 79: "B"
        *   60 to 69: "C"
        *   50 to 59: "D"
        *   Below 50: "Fail"
    *   Log the appropriate grade to the console.
2.  **(1.2)** Farthest Shot-Putter Determination
    
    *   Create three variables for athlete names: `athlete1`, `athlete2`, and `athlete3`, assigning them names (e.g., "Ramesh", "Sita", "Vikram"). Create corresponding variables for their shot-put distances: `distance1`, `distance2`, and `distance3` with assigned values. Write if-else statements to determine which athlete has the farthest shot-put distance and log the name of the farthest shot-putter. If two or more athletes have the same farthest shot-put distance, log a message indicating that as well.
