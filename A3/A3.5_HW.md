## Exercise

1.  **(Inventory Status Check)**
    *   Create variables to represent the stock levels of four products: `product1Stock`, `product2Stock`, `product3Stock`, and `product4Stock`, assigning them numerical values (e.g., 50, 20, 10, and 0).
    *   For each product, write a series of if-else statements to determine its inventory status based on the following criteria:
        *   If stock is 30 or more, the status should be "In Stock".
        *   If stock is between 10 and 29, the status should be "Low Stock".
        *   If stock is less than 10, the status should be "Out of Stock".
    *   Store the status in corresponding variables (`product1Status`, `product2Status`, `product3Status`, and `product4Status`).
2.  **(Display Inventory Report)**
    *   Log an "Inventory Status Report" header to the console.
    *   Then, log the status of each product in the format: "Product1: \[Status\]", "Product2: \[Status\]", etc., using the status variables created in the previous step.
