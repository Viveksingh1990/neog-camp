## Exercise
1.  **(1.1)** Positive Number Check
    
    *   Declare a variable `number` and assign it the value of 10. Write an if-else statement to check if the number is positive, negative, or zero. Log the appropriate message to the console indicating whether the number is positive or negative.
2.  **(1.2)** Highest Marks Determination
    
    *   Create three variables for student names: `student1`, `student2`, and `student3`, assigning them names (e.g., "Rahul", "Priya", "Amit"). Create corresponding variables for their marks: `marks1`, `marks2`, and `marks3` with assigned values. Write if-else statements to determine which student scored the highest marks and log the name of the student with the highest score. If two or more students have the same highest marks, log a message indicating that as well.
