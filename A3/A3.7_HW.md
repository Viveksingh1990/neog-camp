## Exercise

1.  **(Savings Goal Initialization)**
    
    *   Define a variable `goalAmount` representing the total savings goal for the quarter. Set its value to `12000`.
    *   Define variables for the current savings for each month (`currentSavingsMonth1`, `currentSavingsMonth2`, `currentSavingsMonth3`) and set their values to `3000`, `5000`, and `8000` respectively.
    *   Define variables for the savings contributions for each month (`savingsContributionsMonth1`, `savingsContributionsMonth2`, `savingsContributionsMonth3`) and set their values to `1000`, `1500`, and `2000` respectively.
2.  **(Total Current Savings Calculation)**
    
    *   Calculate the total current savings by summing the savings for each month and store it in a variable called `totalCurrentSavings`.
3.  **(Total Savings Contributions Calculation)**
    
    *   Calculate the total savings contributions by summing the contributions for each month and store it in a variable called `totalSavingsContributions`.
4.  **(Quarterly Goal Amount Calculation)**
    
    *   Calculate one-fourth of the savings goal and store it in a variable called `quarterlyGoalAmount`.
5.  **(Percentage of Quarterly Goal Achieved)**
    
    *   Calculate the percentage of the quarterly goal achieved based on the total current savings and the quarterly goal amount, and store it in a variable called `percentageAchieved`.
6.  **(Projected Timeline for Reaching the Goal)**
    
    *   Write conditional statements to determine the projected timeline for reaching the goal based on the percentage achieved. Set the variable `projectedTimeline` to an appropriate message depending on whether the goal has been met, is close to being met, or if more time is needed.
7.  **(Savings Tips)**
    
    *   Write conditional statements to provide savings tips based on the percentage achieved. Set the variable `savingsTips` to a relevant message depending on the progress made towards the goal.
8.  **(Quarterly Savings Report)**
    
    *   Log a summary report to the console that includes:
        *   The goal amount.
        *   The quarterly goal amount.
        *   The total current savings.
        *   The total savings contributions.
        *   The percentage achieved.
        *   The projected timeline for reaching the goal.
        *   The savings tips.
