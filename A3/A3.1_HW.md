1.  **(2.1)** Age Verification
    
    *   Declare a variable `age` and assign it the value of 15. Create a boolean variable `isAdult` and set it to false. Write an if statement to check if the person is not an adult and print "Not an Adult" to the console. Also, log the age to the console.
2.  **(2.2)** Metro Ticket Price Calculation
    
    *   Declare a variable `passengerAge` and assign it the value of 65. Create a variable `originalTicketPrice` and set it to 150. Write an if-else statement to determine the ticket price based on the passenger's age. If the age is greater than 60, apply a 15% discount to the original price and log the discounted price. If the age is 60 or less, log the original price.
3.  **(2.3)** Maximum Score Check
    
    *   Declare three variables: `score1`, `score2`, and `score3`, and assign them values of 85, 90, and 78, respectively. Use if-else statements to determine which student (1, 2, or 3) has the highest score and log the student's number along with the highest score to the console.
4.  **(2.4)** Shopping Cart with Optional Delivery Charge
    
    *   Create variables for four items: `item1`, `item2`, `item3`, and `item4`, assigning them names of your choice (e.g., "Mobile Phone", "Headphones", etc.). Declare corresponding price variables for each item. Log a shopping cart summary including each item and its price to the console. Calculate the total cart price and log it. Implement a delivery charge logic where if the total cart price is less than ₹1999, log an optional delivery charge of ₹99. Otherwise, log that there is no delivery charge.
