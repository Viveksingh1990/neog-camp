## Exercise

1.  **(Employee Data Initialization)**
    
    *   Define variables for three employees, including their names, grades, hours worked, salaries, vacation leaves taken, and sick leaves taken. Use descriptive variable names for each employee, such as:
        *   `employee1Name`, `employee1Grade`, `employee1HoursWorked`, `employee1Salary`, `employee1VacationLeaveTaken`, `employee1SickLeaveTaken`.
        *   Repeat for `employee2` and `employee3`.
2.  **(Bonus Calculation)**
    
    *   For each employee, write if-else statements to calculate the bonus based on the following conditions:
        *   If hours worked are greater than 30 and the grade is greater than 75, the bonus should be 20% of the salary.
        *   If hours worked are greater than 25 and the grade is greater than 95, the bonus should be 15% of the salary.
        *   Otherwise, the bonus should be 10% of the salary.
    *   Store the calculated bonus for each employee in corresponding variables (`employee1Bonus`, `employee2Bonus`, `employee3Bonus`).
3.  **(Display Employee Bonus Information)**
    
    *   Log the name, salary, and bonus percentage of each employee to the console in the following format:
        *   "Employee Name: \[Name\], Salary: â‚¹\[Salary\], Bonus: \[Bonus Percentage\]"
