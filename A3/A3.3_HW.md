## Exercise
1.  **(1.1)** Positive, Negative, or Zero Check
    
    *   Declare a variable `number` and assign it the value of 25. Write an if-else statement to check if the number is positive, negative, or zero. Log the appropriate message to the console indicating whether the number is positive, negative, or zero.
2.  **(1.2)** Fastest Athlete Determination
    
    *   Create three variables for athlete names: `athlete1`, `athlete2`, and `athlete3`, assigning them names (e.g., "Ravi", "Priya", "Amit"). Create corresponding variables for their running times: `time1`, `time2`, and `time3` with assigned values. Write if-else statements to determine which athlete has the fastest running time and log the name of the fastest athlete. If two or more athletes have the same fastest running time, log a message indicating that as well.
