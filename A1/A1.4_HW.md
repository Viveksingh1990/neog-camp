### Question:

Write a JavaScript program that performs a series of exercises involving string concatenation, variable declarations, and console output. Follow the instructions below:

#### Exercise 1: Working with Strings and Variables

1.  **Quarter Months**:
    
    *   Declare three string variables: `month1`, `month2`, and `month3` with the values `"Jan"`, `"Feb"`, and `"March"`.
    *   Concatenate them into a new variable called `quarter`, separated by commas, and print `quarter`.
2.  **Greeting Students**:
    
    *   Define three string variables: `student1`, `student2`, and `student3` with names of students.
    *   Create personalized greetings for each student by concatenating `"good morning,"` with each student's name. Store these greetings in `greeting1`, `greeting2`, and `greeting3` and print each greeting.
3.  **Displaying Numbers**:
    
    *   Declare three numeric variables: `num1`, `num2`, and `num3` with values `10`, `20`, and `30`.
    *   Print the numbers in a single statement, prefixed with the word `"numbers:"`.
4.  **Person Profiles**:
    
    *   Define string variables `person1`, `person2`, and `person3` with names of people, and `profession1`, `profession2`, and `profession3` with their respective professions.
    *   For each person, create a greeting message (`greetings1`, `greetings2`, `greetings3`) that includes a greeting followed by their name (e.g., `"good morning, Munna!"`).
    *   Create a short biography for each person (`bio1`, `bio2`, `bio3`) that includes their name and profession, such as `"Munna is a doctor"`.
    *   Print each greeting and biography.
