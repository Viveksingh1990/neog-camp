## Question:
Write a JavaScript program that demonstrates fundamental JavaScript concepts, including variable declaration, data types, string concatenation, and comments. Perform the following tasks:

### Exercise 1: Working with Strings
1. Declare and Initialize Variables:

      Create a variable myName and assign it your name as a string. Print it to the console.

2. Single Character String:

      Declare a variable singleChar with a single character (e.g., "A") and print it.

3. String with Special Characters:

      Create a variable line that contains a sentence, such as "I'm enjoying my programming journey". Print this sentence to the console.

4. Variable Assignment:

      Declare a variable varOne with a string value, then create another variable varTwo that copies the value of varOne. Print varTwo to the console.

5. String Concatenation:

      Declare two variables, partOne and partTwo, with string values. Concatenate them into a new variable full and print the result.

### Exercise 2: Working with Different Data Types
1. Number Type:

      Declare a variable num with a numeric value (e.g., 10) and print it to the console.

2. Boolean Type:

      Declare two boolean variables, isTrue and isFalse, with values true and false, respectively, and print each to the console.

3. Comments:

      Add multiple lines of comments in your code using // that explain any code segment. Make sure to have at least three commented-out lines, and then print a message "Wooh! Just learned comments" to the console.
This question covers the steps and concepts present in the code, including working with strings, numbers, booleans, variable assignment, concatenation, and comments. It allows learners to get familiar with basic data handling and code organization in JavaScript.
