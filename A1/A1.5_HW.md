### Question:

Write a JavaScript program that performs the following exercises using string concatenation, variable assignments, and console outputs. Each exercise should have its own console section, as shown below.

#### Exercise 1: Working with Days, Employees, and Ages

1.  **Week Days**:
    
    *   Declare three variables `day1`, `day2`, and `day3` and assign them the values `"Monday"`, `"Tuesday"`, and `"Wednesday"`.
    *   Concatenate these variables into a single variable `weekDays`, separating each day with a comma. Print `weekDays` to display all three days in one line.
2.  **Employee Greetings**:
    
    *   Define three variables `employee1`, `employee2`, and `employee3` and assign them names: `"John"`, `"Emily"`, and `"Michael"`.
    *   Create individual greeting messages for each employee by concatenating `"Hola, "` with each name. Store each greeting in `message1`, `message2`, and `message3`, then print each greeting.
3.  **Displaying Ages**:
    
    *   Declare three numeric variables `age1`, `age2`, and `age3` with values `15`, `25`, and `35`, representing ages.
    *   Print each age in a separate console output, following the format: `"The person's age is:"` and the respective age variable (`age1`, `age2`, or `age3`).
