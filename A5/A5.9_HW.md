## Exercise 1
1.1: Print Numbers with Percentage

1.1.1 Write a function twoNumbers(n, m) that prints numbers from 1 to n.

1. If a number is divisible by m but not equal to n, append a % after that number.
2. Call this function with the arguments 20 and 5.

1.2: Print Divisible and Not Divisible Numbers

1.2.1 Write a function twoInputNumbers(n, m) that prints all integers from 10 to n.
1. For numbers divisible by m, print them in one line labeled "Divisible by 5".
2. For numbers not divisible by m, print them in another line labeled "Not Divisible by 5".
3. Call this function with the arguments 30 and 5.

1.3: Print Even Numbers in a Range

1.3.1 Write a function printEvenNumbersBetween(p, n, m) that prints all even numbers between p and m, starting from p.
1. Ensure that the conditions p > n and n < m are satisfied before executing the loop.
2. Call this function with the arguments 8, 5, and 15.
