# Exercise 1: 

## 1.1
Convert the table below into an array of objects
| Day        | Breakfast (cal) | Lunch (cal) | Snacks (cal) | Dinner (cal) |
|------------|-----------------|-------------|--------------|--------------|
| Monday     | 300             | 300         | 150          | 500          |
| Tuesday    | 250             | 450         | 200          | 550          |
| Wednesday  | 350             | 550         | 100          | 700          |
| Thursday   | 400             | 600         | 180          | 650          |
| Friday     | 280             | 480         | 120          | 580          |
| Saturday   | 320             | 520         | 160          | 620          |

 Write a loop to display each day's calorie intake for breakfast, lunch, snacks, and dinner. Print the updated array to the console using for loop.

## 1.2: Add Mid-Afternoon Calories to the above array using a for loop.
```js
const midAfternoonCalories = [100, 120, 105, 110, 100, 130]
```
Print the updated array to the console using for loop.

# Exercise 2:
Another data Sunday joins the food tracker.
| Day        | Breakfast (cal) | Lunch (cal) | Snacks (cal) | Dinner (cal) | Mid-Afternoon (cal) |
|------------|-----------------|-------------|--------------|--------------|----------------------|
| Sunday     | 370             | 430         | 140          | 530          | 150                  |

## 2.1 Convert this table to an object first and print it.
## 2.2 Add sundayData to our foodTracker and print the whole array of objects once.
## 2.3 Use a loop to calculate and add a totalCalorie property to each day in the foodTracker array based on the calorie intake for all meals. Then print the updated array.
## 2.4 Use a loop to calculate the average calorie intake per meal for each day and add an avgCalorie property. Then print the updated array

# Exercise 3: 
Let's create calorie cards for each day.
Calculate avgCalorie Comment for each day based on the following condition:

* "Your calorie intake was within limits" if 1550 or less
* otherwise "Your calorie intake was higher than recommended".
