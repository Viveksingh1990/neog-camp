# Exercise 1: 

## 1.1
Convert the table below into an array of objects
| Day        | Breakfast (cal) | Lunch (cal) | Snacks (cal) | Dinner (cal) |
|------------|-----------------|-------------|--------------|--------------|
| Monday     | 300             | 300         | 150          | 500          |
| Tuesday    | 250             | 450         | 200          | 550          |
| Wednesday  | 350             | 550         | 100          | 700          |
| Thursday   | 400             | 600         | 180          | 650          |
| Friday     | 280             | 480         | 120          | 580          |
| Saturday   | 320             | 520         | 160          | 620          |

 Write a loop to display each day's calorie intake for breakfast, lunch, snacks, and dinner. Print the updated array to the console using for loop.

## 1.2: Add Mid-Afternoon Calories to the above array using a for loop.
```js
const midAfternoonCalories = [100, 120, 105, 110, 100, 130]
```
Print the updated array to the console using for loop.

# Exercise 2:
Another data Sunday joins the food tracker.
| Day        | Breakfast (cal) | Lunch (cal) | Snacks (cal) | Dinner (cal) | Mid-Afternoon (cal) |
|------------|-----------------|-------------|--------------|--------------|----------------------|
| Sunday     | 370             | 430         | 140          | 530          | 150                  |

## 2.1 Convert this table to an object first and print it.
## 2.2 Add sundayData to our foodTracker and print the whole array of objects once.
## 2.3 Use a loop to calculate and add a totalCalorie property to each day in the foodTracker array based on the calorie intake for all meals. Then print the updated array.
## 2.4 Use a loop to calculate the average calorie intake per meal for each day and add an avgCalorie property. Then print the updated array

# Exercise 3: Calorie Card with Comment
## 3.1: Displaying Calorie Card
### 3.1.1 Create a function calorieCard that takes a day’s data and displays a calorie card with the day’s name, calorie intake for each meal, total calorie intake, average calorie intake, and a comment.
1. Each calorie card should include all relevant details for each day.

## 3.2: Providing Intake Comment
### 3.2.1 Create a function getComment that returns a comment based on the total calorie intake:
"Your calorie intake was within limits" if 1550 or less, otherwise "Your calorie intake was higher than recommended".
1. Confirm that each day’s comment is correct based on the total calorie intake.
