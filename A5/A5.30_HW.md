 Write a loop to display each day's calorie intake for breakfast, lunch, snacks, and dinner. Print the updated array to the console using for loop.

## 1.2: Add Mid-Afternoon Calories to the above array using a for loop.
```js
const midAfternoonCalories = [100, 120, 105, 110, 100, 130]
```
Print the updated array to the console using for loop.

# Exercise 2: Adding Sunday Data
## 2.1: Creating Sunday's Data

1. Output should show complete calorie data for Sunday.

## 2.2: Adding Sunday to Food Tracker
### 2.2.1 Add sundayData to the foodTracker array and display the updated array.
1. Ensure Sunday’s data is included in the output.

## 2.3: Calculating Total Calorie Intake for Each Day
### 2.3.1 Use a loop to calculate and add a totalCalorie property to each day in the foodTracker array based on the calorie intake for all meals. Display the array with the totalCalorie included.
1. Output should reflect each day's total calorie intake.
## 2.4: Calculating Average Calorie Intake per Meal
### 2.4.1 Use a loop to calculate the average calorie intake per meal for each day and add an avgCalorie property. Display the updated array.
1. Output should include each day's average calorie intake.

# Exercise 3: Calorie Card with Comment
## 3.1: Displaying Calorie Card
### 3.1.1 Create a function calorieCard that takes a day’s data and displays a calorie card with the day’s name, calorie intake for each meal, total calorie intake, average calorie intake, and a comment.
1. Each calorie card should include all relevant details for each day.

## 3.2: Providing Intake Comment
### 3.2.1 Create a function getComment that returns a comment based on the total calorie intake:
