## Question
Create a program in JavaScript that analyzes a list of products and generates a report. The report should include the following details:

1. Most Expensive Product Details: Identify and display the name, price, brand, category, and rating of the most expensive product in the list.

2. Totals and Averages:

   1. Count the total number of products in the "Electronics" category.
   2. Calculate and display the average price of all products.
    3. Calculate and display the average rating of all products.

3. Product with Highest Rating: Identify and display the details (name, price, brand, category, rating) of the product with the highest rating.

4. Products with Price Less Than $50: List all products with a price below $50, displaying each product's name, price, brand, category, and rating.

Use the following array of product objects for this analysis:

```
javascript
const productsData = [
  { id: 101, name: "Laptop", price: 999.99, brand: "Dell", category: "Electronics", rating: 4.5 },
  { id: 102, name: "Smartphone", price: 599.99, brand: "Samsung", category: "Electronics", rating: 4.0 },
  { id: 103, name: "Running Shoes", price: 79.99, brand: "Nike", category: "Footwear", rating: 4.8 },
  { id: 104, name: "T-shirt", price: 19.99, brand: "Adidas", category: "Apparel", rating: 4.2 },
  { id: 105, name: "Coffee Maker", price: 49.99, brand: "Hamilton", category: "Kitchen Appliances", rating: 4.6 }
];
```
Implement functions to:

1. Find the most expensive product.
2. Count the total number of "Electronics" products.
3. Calculate the average price and average rating.
4. Find the product with the highest rating.
5. List products with a price under $50.
Finally, create a genrateProductAnalysisReport function that compiles this data into a formatted string report, and print it to the console.
