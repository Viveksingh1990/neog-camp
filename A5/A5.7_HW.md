## Exercise 1
1.1: Print Number Pattern with Hashes

1.1.1 Write a function printNumberPattern(n, m) that prints numbers from 1 to n. If a number is divisible by m and not equal to n, append a # after that number. Call this function with the arguments 9 and 3.

1.2: Print Divisible and Not Divisible Numbers

1.2.1 Write a function printDivisibleAndNotDivisible(n, m) that prints all integers from 1 to n.
For numbers divisible by m, print them in one line.
For numbers not divisible by m, print them in another line. Call this function with the arguments 10 and 3.

1.3: Print Divisible Numbers Between Two Limits

1.3.1 Write a function printDivisibleNumbersBetween(p, n, m) that prints all numbers between n and m (inclusive) that are divisible by p.
Ensure that the condition p < n < m is checked before executing the loop. Call this function with the arguments 2, 3, and 9.
