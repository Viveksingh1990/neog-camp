1. Output should show each cricketer’s score at each stadium.

1.2 Add scores for Chinnaswamy Stadium, to the above array using for loop.
```js
const chinnaswamyStadiumScores = [54, 82, 49, 45]
```
Print the updated array to the console using for loop.

# Exercise 2: Adding KL Rahul's Data
2.1: Creating KL Rahul's Score Object
2.1.1 Create an object klRahulData with KL Rahul’s scores for each stadium, including Chinnaswamy Stadium. Display the object.
1. Output should display KL Rahul’s complete score details.

2.2: Adding KL Rahul to Scores Array
2.2.1 Add klRahulData to the scores array and display the updated array.
1. Ensure that the output reflects the inclusion of KL Rahul’s data.

2.3: Calculating Total Score for Each Cricketer
2.3.1 Use a loop to calculate and add a totalScore property to each cricketer in the scores array based on their scores across all stadiums. Display the array with the totalScore included.
1. Output should show each cricketer’s total score.

2.4: Calculating Average Score for Each Cricketer
2.4.1 Use a loop to calculate the average score for each cricketer based on the totalScore and number of stadiums (5). Add an avgRun property to each cricketer’s data and display the updated array.
1.Output should include each cricketer’s average score.

## Exercise 3: Score Card with Performance
3.1: Displaying Score Card
3.1.1 Create a function scorecard that takes a cricketer's data and displays a scorecard with their name, scores for each stadium, total score, average score, and performance.
1. Ensure each scorecard includes all relevant details.
3.2: Determining Performance Rating
3.2.1 Create a function getPerformance that returns a performance rating based on the average score (avgRun):
"Good" if 80 or above, "Above Average" if 60-79, "Average" if 45-59, and "Bad" if below 45.
1. Confirm the output reflects the correct performance rating based on each cricketer’s average score.
