# Exercise 1: Cricketer Scores

## 1.1: Convert the table below into an array of objects

| Name      | Eden Gardens | Wankhede Stadium | Feroz Shah Kotla | Chepauk |
|-----------|--------------|------------------|------------------|---------|
| Virat     | 72           | 88               | 45               | 74      |
| Rohit     | 64           | 41               | 68               | 34      |
| Shikhar   | 54           | 38               | 72               | 44      |
| Rishabh   | 22           | 27               | 34               | 51      |

### 1.1.1 Write a loop to display each cricketer's name and their scores for Eden Gardens, Wankhede Stadium, Feroz Shah Kotla, and Chepauk.
1. Output should show each cricketer’s score at each stadium.

## 1.2 Add scores for Chinnaswamy Stadium, to the above array using for loop.
```js
const chinnaswamyStadiumScores = [54, 82, 49, 45]
```
Print the updated array to the console using for loop.

# Exercise 2:
Another crickets KL Rahul to the scores. Here's her data.
| Name     | Eden Gardens | Wankhede Stadium | Feroz Shah Kotla | Chepauk | Chinnaswamy Stadium |
|----------|--------------|------------------|------------------|---------|---------------------|
| KL Rahul | 34           | 56               | 42               | 31      | 68                  |

## 2.1 Convert this table to an object first and print it.

## 2.2 Add KL Rahul's Data to our scores and print the whole array of objects once.

## 2.4 Use a loop to calculate and add a totalScore property to each cricketer in the scores array based on their scores across all stadiums. Then print the updated array.

## 2.5 Use a loop to calculate the average score for each cricketer based on the totalScore and number of stadiums (5). Add an avgRun property to each cricketer’s data and print the updated array.

# Exercise 3:

## 3.1: Let's create report cards for each crickets.
### 3.1.1 Create a function scorecard that takes a cricketer's data and displays a scorecard with their name, scores for each stadium, total score, average score, and performance.
1. Ensure each scorecard includes all relevant details.

## 3.2: Determining Performance Rating
## 3.3 Calculate performance for every student based on the following condition:
* "Good" for more than or equal to 80 as an average,
* "Above Average" for average between 60 and 79,
* "Average" for average between 45 and 59,
* "Bad" for below 45.

Use the following template to print report card for every cricketer to the console:
