## Exercise 1

### Create a citizen object with two properties, name and age. Assign name as "Sandeep" and age as 65.

#### 1.1 Compare the 'age' property of the citizen object with 60 to check senior citizenship. If age is greater than or equal to 60, console a message in the format "{name} is a senior citizen." If age is less than 60, console a message in the format "{name} is not a senior citizen."

#### 1.2 Add a property bp to the citizen object. Assign the value "Normal" to it.

#### 1.3 If the age is greater than or equal to 60 and the bp is normal, console a message in the format: "Fit to travel". Otherwise print, "Not fit to travel."
