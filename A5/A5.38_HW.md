## Question:

You are tasked with creating a payroll system for a company that tracks the hours worked by its employees and calculates their salaries, including bonuses. Write a JavaScript program that performs the following:

1. **Input Data:** Create an array of employee objects, each containing the following properties:

    1. Name (string)
    1. Department (string)
    1. hourlySalary (number)
    1. week1Hours, week2Hours, week3Hours, week4Hours (numbers representing the hours worked each week)
    1. bonusMultiplier (number)

2. **Total Hours Calculation:** Implement a function that calculates the total hours worked over four weeks for each employee.

3. **Salary Calculation:** Implement a function that calculates each employee's total salary for four weeks, including any bonus. A bonus is applicable if the employee works more than 160 hours (40 hours per week) across the four weeks. The bonus is calculated as the number of hours over 160 multiplied by the hourlySalary and bonusMultiplier.

4. **Generate Payslips:** Implement a function that generates payslips for each employee, displaying their name, department, total hours worked, total salary, and bonus.

5. **Most Paid Employee:** Implement a function that identifies and returns the employee with the highest total salary.

6. **Company Averages:** Implement a function that calculates and returns average statistics for the company, including total hours worked, total salary paid, and average hours worked per week across all employees.

7. **Human Resource Report:** Create a function that generates a report summarizing the most paid employee and the company averages calculated in the previous steps.

8. **Output:** Log the employee data, payslips, and human resource report to the console.
