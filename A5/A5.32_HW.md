Given an array of objects of students data.

```jsx
const studentData = [
  { studentName: "John", rollNo: 201, science: 88, history: 75, geography: 90 },
  { studentName: "Alice", rollNo: 202, science: 92, history: 85, geography: 88 },
  { studentName: "Bob", rollNo: 203, science: 78, history: 89, geography: 91 }
];
```

1.1 Write a function to take a rollNo and print the report card for that student. Run that function with three rollNos (201, 202 and 203) one by one and print 3 report cards.

For Science, the cutoff is 80.
