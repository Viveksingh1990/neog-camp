## 1.2 Add marks of one more subject, science, to the above array using a for loop.

```js
const marksForScience = [82, 90, 88]
```
Print the updated array to the console using for loop.

# Exercise 2

Another student Kaveri joins the class. Here's her data.
| Name   | Roll No | Hindi | English | Maths | Computers | Science |
|--------|---------|-------|---------|-------|-----------|---------|
| Kaveri | 104     | 84    | 88      | 78    | 90        | 86      |


## 2.1 Convert this table to an object first and print it.

## 2.2 Add Kaveri's Data to our studentsData and print the whole array of objects once.

## 2.3 Add a field totalMarks to every object in the array. Calculate the total marks for each student and update the field with it. Then print the updated array.

## 2.4 Using the total marks field, now calculate the average marks scored by the student. Add this field avgMarks to each object in the array. Print the updated array.

# Exercise 3

## Let's create report cards for each student.

Calculate grade for every student based on the following condition:

* A for more than or equal to 90 as an average,
* B for average between 80 and 90,
* C for average between 70 and 79,
* D for average between 60 and 69,
* E for average between 50 and 59 and
