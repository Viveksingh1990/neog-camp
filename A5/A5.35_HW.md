  { name: "Michael", rollNo: 202, chemistry: 75, homeScience: 90, commerce: 85, physicalEducation: 94, moralScience: 88, totalMarks: 432, avgMarks: 86.4 },
  
  { name: "Emily", rollNo: 203, chemistry: 82, homeScience: 95, commerce: 88, physicalEducation: 92, moralScience: 90, totalMarks: 447, avgMarks: 89.4 },
  
  { name: "David", rollNo: 204, chemistry: 95, homeScience: 96, commerce: 94, physicalEducation: 99, moralScience: 99, totalMarks: 483, avgMarks: 96.6 },
