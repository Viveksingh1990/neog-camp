## Question: Sales Performance Analysis

1. You are given an array of salespersons' data, where each salesperson has the following properties: name, location, and sales for each quarter (e.g., q1Sales, q2Sales, q3Sales, q4Sales). Your task is to perform various analyses on this data.

2. Write a function to calculate the total and average sales for each salesperson based on their quarterly sales.

3. Implement a function that assigns a performance grade to each salesperson based on their average sales:

    1. "Top Performer" for average sales of 140,000 or more.
    2. "Medium Performer" for average sales between 120,000 and 140,000.
    3. "Low Performer" for average sales below 120,000.

4. Generate a performance report that includes:

    1. Each salesperson's name, location, total sales, average sales, and performance grade.

5. Create additional functions to:

    1. Identify the best performer (the salesperson with the highest total sales).
    2. List all top performers.
    3. Calculate the average sales for each quarter across all salespersons.
    4. Calculate the overall total and average sales.


6. Finally, implement an annual sales report that summarizes the best performer, the top performers, and the average sales for each quarter as well as the total sales and average sales for the year.

7. Output the results of the performance report and the annual sales report.
