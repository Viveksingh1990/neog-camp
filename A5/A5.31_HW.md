# Exercise 1: Student Data and Report Card
Convert the table below into an array of objects

| Name  | Roll No | Hindi (marks) | English (marks) | Maths (marks) |
|-------|---------|---------------|------------------|---------------|
| Anu   | 101     | 80            | 75               | 90            |
| Priya | 102     | 85            | 70               | 95            |
| Ravi  | 103     | 78            | 92               | 87            |
Print the updated array to the console using for loop.

1.1: Displaying Report Card by Roll Number
1.1.1 Write a function printReportCard that takes a rollNo and prints a report card for that student, including their name, roll number, and marks in Hindi, English, and Maths.
1. Test with rollNo values of 101, 102, and 103.

1.2: Filtering Students by Subject Cutoff
1.2.1 Write a function getStudentsDataByCutoff that takes a subjectName and a cutOff value. It should return students whose marks in that subject exceed the cutoff.
1. Test with Hindi cutoff > 80, Maths cutoff > 90, and English cutoff > 90.
2. Display the resulting student data for each test case.

# Exercise 2: Calculating Total and Average Marks
2.1: Adding Total and Average Marks
2.1.1 Write a loop to calculate and add totalMarks and avgMarks properties for each student based on their marks in Hindi, English, and Maths. Display the updated array.
1. Confirm that each studentâ€™s totalMarks and avgMarks are correctly calculated.

2.2: Printing Students with Average Marks Above a Cutoff
2.2.1 Write a function printStudentsAboveAverage that takes an avgCutOff and prints the names of students whose avgMarks exceed this cutoff.
1. Test with an average cutoff of 82.

## Exercise 3: Finding the Highest Average Marks
3.1: Identifying the Student with the Highest Average Marks
3.1.1 Write a function getHighestAverageMarks that finds and returns the highest avgMarks among all students.
1. Display the highest average marks.
