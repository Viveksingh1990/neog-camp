## 1.1: Print Numbers from 100 to 120
1.1.1 Write a for loop to print all integers from 100 to 120.

## 1.2: Create a Pattern with the Number "9"
1.2.1 Define a variable pattern as an empty string.
1.2.2 Write a loop that appends the number "9" to pattern in each iteration. Print pattern after each addition, until it contains four "9"s.

## 1.3: Create a Pattern with the Letter "z"
1.3.1 Define a variable pattern2 as an empty string.
1.3.2 Write a loop that appends the letter "z" to pattern2 in each iteration. Print pattern2 after each addition, until it contains five "z"s.

## 1.4: Create a Pattern with Asterisks (*)
1.4.1 Define a variable pattern3 as an empty string.
1.4.2 Write a loop that appends an asterisk (*) to pattern3 in each iteration. Print pattern3 after each addition, until it contains five asterisks.

## 1.5: Create a Pattern with Incremental Numbers
1.5.1 Define a variable pattern4 as an empty string.
1.5.2 Write a loop that appends the current loop index to pattern4 in each iteration. Print pattern4 after each addition, until it contains the numbers from 1 to 9.

## 1.6: Print the Multiplication Table of 5
1.6.1 Write a loop to calculate and print the first ten multiples of 5, in the format "5 * i = result".

## 1.7: Print the Squares of Numbers from 21 to 25
1.7.1 Write a loop to calculate and print the squares of each integer from 21 to 25, in the format "i * i = result".
