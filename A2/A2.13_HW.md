## Exercise 1

1.  **(1.1)** Declare variables for the quantities and prices of three books: `book1Quantity`, `book2Quantity`, `book3Quantity`, `book1Price`, `book2Price`, and `book3Price`. Log the quantities and prices of each book to the console.
    
2.  **(1.2)** Calculate the value of each book by multiplying the quantity by the price. Store these values in variables: `book1Value`, `book2Value`, and `book3Value`. Log the value of each book to the console.
    
3.  **(1.3)** Calculate the total inventory value by summing the values of all three books. Log the total inventory value to the console.
    
## Exercise 2

1.  **(2.1)** Declare variables for four contractors: `contractor1`, `contractor2`, `contractor3`, and `contractor4`. Assign their names to these variables.
    
2.  **(2.2)** For each contractor, declare variables for their job descriptions, hourly rates, hours worked, and ratings. Use the following job descriptions: "Web Developer", "Content Writer", "Graphic Designer", and "Digital Marketer". Also, use the provided hourly rates, hours worked, and ratings.
    
3.  **(2.3)** Determine eligibility for a goodie bag for each contractor based on the condition that they have worked more than 15 hours or have a rating greater than 85. Store these boolean values in variables: `isEligibleForGoodieBag1`, `isEligibleForGoodieBag2`, `isEligibleForGoodieBag3`, and `isEligibleForGoodieBag4`.
    
4.  **(2.4)** Calculate the total payment for each contractor by multiplying their hourly rate by the hours worked. Store these values in variables: `totalPayment1`, `totalPayment2`, `totalPayment3`, and `totalPayment4`.
    
5.  **(2.5)** Print out the contractor details, including their name, job description, hourly rate, hours worked, total payment, ratings, and eligibility for the goodie bag to the console. Format the output with headings and separators for clarity.

## Exercise 3

1.  **(1.1)** Declare variables for the number of tickets sold for three movies: `movie1TicketsSold`, `movie2TicketsSold`, and `movie3TicketsSold`. Assign the values: 150, 120, and 80, respectively.
    
2.  **(1.2)** Declare variables for the ticket prices for each movie: `movie1TicketPrice`, `movie2TicketPrice`, and `movie3TicketPrice`. Assign the values: 250, 180, and 150, respectively.
    
3.  **(1.3)** Calculate the revenue generated from ticket sales for each movie by multiplying the number of tickets sold by the ticket price. Store these values in variables: `movie1Revenue`, `movie2Revenue`, and `movie3Revenue`.
    
4.  **(1.4)** Determine if each movie is a superhit by checking if its revenue exceeds â‚¹5000. Store these boolean values in variables: `isMovie1Superhit`, `isMovie2Superhit`, and `isMovie3Superhit`.
    
5.  **(1.5)** Calculate the total revenue from all three movies by summing their individual revenues. Store this value in the variable `totalRevenue`.
    
6.  **(1.6)** Print out a detailed movie ticket sales report to the console, including each movie's name, tickets sold, ticket price, revenue, and whether it is a superhit. Format the output with headings and separators for clarity.
    
7.  **(1.7)** At the end of the report, print the total revenue from all movie ticket sales.
