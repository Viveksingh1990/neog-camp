## exercise 1

### 1.1

In this exercise, you will evaluate a student's performance based on their marks in three subjects and the presence of a drama school endorsement. You will calculate their grade and make a choice based on the average grade and endorsement.

1. Declare three variables, **`subject1Marks`**, **`subject2Marks`**, and **`subject3Marks`**, and assign them the respective marks for the three subjects.
    - **`subject1Marks`**: 85
    - **`subject2Marks`**: 92
    - **`subject3Marks`**: 78
2. Calculate the average marks by adding the marks of all three subjects and dividing the sum by 3. Assign the result to a variable named **`averageMarks`**.
3. Declare a variable named **`hasDramaSchoolEndorsement`** and assign it a boolean value (**`true`**) indicating that the student has a drama school endorsement.
4. Evaluate the student's performance and make a choice based on the average marks and endorsement. If the average marks are greater than or equal to 80 or the student has a drama school endorsement, print to the console: “Is the user selected? {result}”.

### 1.2

1. Declare two variables, **`foodBill`** and **`hasZomatoGoldMembership`**, and assign them the values of **`1500`** and **`true`**, respectively.
2. Check whether a user qualifies to pay the food bill at a discounted price based on the following criteria. Any one of the criteria should suffice for the user to qualify:
    - The food bill is less than Rs. 2000.
    - The user has a Zomato Gold Membership.
3. Assign the result to a variable named **`qualifiesForDiscountedBill`**.
4. Print the result to the console using the following format: "Does the user qualify to pay the food bill at a discounted price? {result}".

### 1.3

1. Declare five variables, **`piggybank1Balance`**, **`piggybank2Balance`**, **`penCost`**, **`notebookCost`** and **`pencilCost`**, and assign them the values **`2000`**, **`1500`**, **`50`**, **`100`** and **`20`**, respectively.
2. Calculate the total cost of the items by adding the costs of a pen, notebook, and pencil. Assign the result to a variable named **`totalCost`**.
3. Check if the purchase is affordable based on the available bank balance in any one of the piggy banks. The purchase is considered affordable if the total cost is less than or equal to the balance of either Piggy Bank 1 or Piggy Bank 2.
4. Assign the result of the check to a variable named **`canWeAffordStationery`**.
5. Print the result to the console using the following format: "Can you afford the purchase? {result}"

This is how your homework output for exercise 1 should look in the console.
