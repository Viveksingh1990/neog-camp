#### Exercise 1

1.  **(1.1)** Declare two variables, `numberOne` and `numberTwo`, and assign them values of your choice. Calculate the sum of these two numbers and log the individual numbers and the result to the console.
2.  **(1.2)** Calculate the difference between `numberOne` and `numberTwo` and log the individual numbers and the result to the console.
3.  **(1.3)** Calculate the product of `numberOne` and `numberTwo` and log the individual numbers and the result to the console.
4.  **(1.4)** Calculate the division of `numberOne` by `numberTwo` and log the individual numbers and the result to the console.
5.  **(1.5)** Calculate the remainder of `numberOne` divided by `numberTwo` and log the individual numbers and the result to the console.

#### Exercise 2

1.  **(2.1)** Declare a third variable, `numberThree`, and assign it a value of your choice. Calculate the sum of `numberOne`, `numberTwo`, and `numberThree`. Log the individual numbers and the result to the console.
2.  **(2.2)** Subtract the sum of `numberOne` and `numberTwo` from `numberThree` and log the individual numbers and the result to the console.
3.  **(2.3)** Calculate the product of `numberOne` and `numberTwo`, then add `numberThree` to the result. Log the individual numbers and the result to the console.
4.  **(2.4)** Divide `numberThree` by `numberOne` and then add `numberTwo` to the result. Log the individual numbers and the result to the console.
5.  **(2.5)** Calculate the average of `numberOne`, `numberTwo`, and `numberThree`. Log the individual numbers and the result to the console.
