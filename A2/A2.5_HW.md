#### Exercise 1

1.  **(1.1)** Declare two variables, `akshayTime` and `raviTime`, and assign them values representing their times in a 100m sprint. Determine if Akshay is faster than Ravi and log the result to the console.
2.  **(1.2)** Declare two variables, `akshayTime400` and `raviTime400`, for their times in a 400m race. Check if Akshay is faster than Ravi in this race and log the result to the console.
3.  **(1.3)** Declare two variables, `akshayDistance` and `raviDistance`, to represent their long jump distances. Determine if Akshay made a longer jump than Ravi and log the result to the console.
4.  **(1.4)** Declare two variables, `akshayDistanceShotPut` and `raviDistanceShotPut`, for their shot put distances. Check if Akshay made a longer throw than Ravi and log the result to the console.
5.  **(1.5)** Declare two variables, `akshayHeight` and `raviHeight`, for their jump heights. Determine if Akshay jumped higher than Ravi and log the result to the console.

#### Exercise 2

1.  **(2.1)** Declare variables for the prices of milk and bread (`milkPrice` and `breadPrice`) and a `budget`. Check if you can buy both items within your budget and log the result to the console.
2.  **(2.2)** Declare variables for the scores of four cricket clubs (`gangaCricketClubScore`, `yamunaCricketClubScore`, `narmadaCricketClubScore`, and `godavariCricketClubScore`). Calculate the average score and determine if it meets or exceeds a minimum average score of 60. Log the result to the console.
