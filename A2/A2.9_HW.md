### 1.1

In this exercise, you will evaluate a cricketer's performance based on his runs scored in three matches, batting average, and his fielding skills. The cricketer's selection will depend on his batting average being more than 60 and his excellent fielding.

1. Declare three variables, **`runsMatch1`**, **`runsMatch2`**, and **`runsMatch3`**, and assign them the respective runs scored by the cricketer in three matches.
    - **`runsMatch1`**: 78
    - **`runsMatch2`**: 102
    - **`runsMatch3`**: 45
2. Calculate the total runs scored by adding the runs scored in all three matches. Assign the result to a variable named **`totalRuns`**.
3. Calculate the batting average by dividing the total runs by 3. Assign the result to a variable named **`battingAverage`**.
4. Declare a variable named **`excellentFielding`** and assign it a boolean value (**`true`**) indicating that the cricketer has done excellent fielding.
5. Evaluate the cricketer's performance and make a selection based on his batting average and fielding skills i.e If the batting average is more than 60 and the cricketer has done excellent fielding, then the cricketer is selected.
6. Print result to the console in the following format: “Is the cricketer selected? {result}”.

### 1.2

1. Declare two variables, **`gymMembership`** and **`purchaseAmount`**, and assign them the values of **`true`** and **`1500`**, respectively.

    - The user has a gym membership.
    - The purchase amount is more than Rs. 1499.
3. Assign the result of the check to a variable named **`qualifiesForDiscountedPurchase`**.
