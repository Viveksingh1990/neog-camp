### Exercise 1

1.  **(1.1)** Declare two variables, `numOne` and `numTwo`. Assign them values of your choice. Calculate the sum of these two numbers and log the numbers and the result to the console.
2.  **(1.2)** Calculate the difference between `numOne` and `numTwo` and log the numbers and the result to the console.
3.  **(1.3)** Calculate the product of `numOne` and `numTwo` and log the numbers and the result to the console.
4.  **(1.4)** Calculate the division of `numOne` by `numTwo` and log the numbers and the result to the console.
5.  **(1.5)** Calculate the remainder of `numOne` divided by `numTwo` and log the numbers and the result to the console.

### Exercise 2

1.  **(2.1)** Declare a third variable, `numThree`, and assign it a value of your choice. Calculate the sum of `numOne`, `numTwo`, and `numThree`. Log the numbers and the result to the console.
2.  **(2.2)** Subtract the sum of `numOne` and `numTwo` from `numThree` and log the numbers and the result to the console.
3.  **(2.3)** Calculate the product of `numOne` and `numTwo`, then add `numThree` to the result. Log the numbers and the result to the console.
4.  **(2.4)** Divide `numThree` by `numOne` and then add `numTwo` to the result. Log the numbers and the result to the console.
5.  **(2.5)** Calculate the average of `numOne`, `numTwo`, and `numThree`. Log the numbers and the result to the console.
